# GPU Passthrough
## Enable IOMMU in the BIOS
Via the following options:
* SVM mode
* SR-IOV
* IOMMU

## Enable IOMMMU support in Proxmox
* Edit the following line in `/etc/default/grub`: 
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="iommu=pt initcall_blacklist=sysfb_init nomodeset video=vesa:off"
```
* Run `update-grub` to make the above changes effective at the next reboot
* Blacklist AMD GPU and Intel sound modules in `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`:
```
echo "blacklist snd_hda_intel" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist amdgpu"  >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist radeon" >>  >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```
* As an **alternative** to the above, use `sofdep`:
```
echo "softdep radeon pre: vfio-pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
echo "softdep amdgpu pre: vfio-pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
echo "softdep snd_hda_intel pre: vfio-pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```
* Add vfio modules in `/etc/modules`:
```
echo "vfio" >> /etc/modules
echo "vfio_iommu_type1" >> /etc/modules
echo "vfio_pci" >> /etc/modules
```
* Note: `vfio_virqfd` is present in multipe guides online, but it should not be required with kernels >= 6.2.x as it is been folded directly into the vfio module. See for example [this document](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/pci-gpu-passthrough-on-proxmox-ve-8-installation-and-configuration.130218/) at the section "VFIO modules and verification of remapping support"
* Check the GPU device and vendor IDs:
```
lspci -nn | grep -e 'AMD/ATI'
```
* Add the GPU and Integrated HD Audio device IDs to `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf`:
```on 
echo "options vfio-pci ids=1002:1636,1002:1637" >> /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```
* Rebuild the initrd image and reboot:
```
update-initramfs -u -k all
shutdown -r now
```
* After rebooting , Verify IOMMU is enabled:
```
dmesg | grep -i -e DMAR -e IOMMU
```
## Creating the Windows VM
* See the steps in the ["Creating the Windows VM"](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-the-windows-vm) section of this document.
## Configuring the GPU in the Windows VM
The instructions [here](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-the-gpu-in-the-windows-vm) are generally applicable, with the following changes / caveats:
1. For Ryzen APU passthrough the section [(optional) Getting OVMF (UEFI) BIOS working: Error 43](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-the-gpu-in-the-windows-vm) is indeed required, i.e.: *two* files must be passed to the VM:
  * The VGA vBIOS. As an example, this is referenced as `vbios_1636.dat` in the rest of this document.
  * The AMDGopDriver. As an example, this is referenced as `AMDGopDriver.rom` in the rest of this document.
2. Neither of theese methods to extract the vBIOS worked in my case:
  * Using the `vbios.c` file as reported [here](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-the-gpu-in-the-windows-vm).
  * Using the [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/) "save bios" function running on baremetal Windows 11, as reported in various forums.

So the problem remains of how to get the VGA vBIOS and the AMDGopDriver files.
The only way that really worked in my case was to use the [UBU utility](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/tool-guide-news-uefi-bios-updater-ubu/30357) to extract both files from the BIOS motherboard file provided by the hardware vendor. 

The detailed steps are described [below](#Extracting-vBIOS-and-AMDGopDriver-with-UBU) and are based on [this note](https://gist.github.com/matt22207/bb1ba1811a08a715e32f106450b0418a?permalink_comment_id=4955044#gistcomment-4955044).

### Using the vBIOS and AMDGopDriver in the VM config
Once the VGA vBIOS and the AMDGopDriver files are extracted and copied to the Proxmox host in the directory `/usr/share/kvm/` they can be referenced in the VM config, via two config lines that should look something like:
```
hostpci0: 0000:34:00.0,pcie=1,romfile=vbios_1636.dat
hostpci1: 0000:34:00.1,pcie=1,romfile=AMDGopDriver.rom
```
> [!NOTE]
> The actual PCI addresses in the config snippets above will vary depending on the actual hardware configuration

Once that is done, it is possible to boot the Windows VM and complete the following steps:
1. Run the VM and install the most recent [VirtIO drivers](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers) (virtio-win-guest-tools.exe).
2. Install the official [AMD GPU drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/drivers.html/processors/ryzen-pro/ryzen-pro-4000-series/amd-ryzen-3-pro-4350g.html). Use the OFFLINE installer, the online installer will complain that the computer is not an official AMD computer.
3. Install [RadeonResetBugFix service](https://github.com/inga-lovinde/RadeonResetBugFix) to make sure the GPU can be transferred properly to the host after stopping the VM. If this is not done, you will suffer from the famous "AMD Reset Bug".
4. Finally, reboot the VM and follow [these instuctions](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-gpu-as-the-primary-gpu) to use the APU GPU as the primary GPU for the windows VM. 

### Extracting vBIOS and AMDGopDriver with UBU
This method also has the following advantages:
1. It enables extraction of *both* the vBIOS and the AMDGopDriver files from the vendor provided BIOS motherboard file. No need to download the AMDGopDriver from random sources.
2. It ensures the files that will be passed to the VM are in sync with the motherbaord model and BIOS version.

Still, it relies on UBU, a 3rd party unverified BIOS extracting utility, so it certainly introduces some unknowns... Use it at your own risk ðŸ˜ƒ.

To extract the required files:
* Download the the motherboard BIOS update from the Vendor site. Make sure to use the same BIOS version as the one flashed on the motherboard.
   * Example: `PRIME-B450M-A-II-ASUS-4622.zip`
* Download and extract the [UBU utility](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/tool-guide-news-uefi-bios-updater-ubu/30357) to a local directory on a Windows machine (*not* the VM).
* The UBU utility expects a file named `bios.bin` in this directory:
  * Unzip the BIOS file (e.g.: `PRIME-B450M-A-II-ASUS-4622.zip`), copy its content (`PRIME-B450M-A-II-ASUS-4622.cap`) to the UBU directory and rename it as `bios.bin`, then run `ubu.cmd`
  * The UBU utility will extract the file and present a set of interactive menus. Make sure to select the "Video OnBoard" option and then the "Extracted" option (to save the files to disk) E.g.:  
```

* When UBU exits, there will be an `Extracted` folder with two subfolders, one for the vBIOS and another one for the GOP driver, respectively. These contains the required files!
* For the AMDGopDriver, one extra step is required: UBU produces a file in `efi` format, but according to the [source notes](https://github.com/isc30/ryzen-7000-series-proxmox?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-getting-ovmf-uefi-bios-working-error-43) a file in `rom` format is required instead.
* A `rom` file can be generated following the procedure [here](https://gist.github.com/matt22207/bb1ba1811a08a715e32f106450b0418a?permalink_comment_id=4955044#gistcomment-4955044) starting from `efi` just extracted. I.e.:
  * Download `EfiRom.exe` from [here](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32).
  * Get the the Vendor and Device ID for the integrated Audio Controller by running `lspci -nn | grep -e 'AMD/ATI'`, e.g.: 
    ```
    lspci -nn | grep -e 'AMD/ATI'
    09:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Renoir [1002:1636] (rev da)
    09:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Renoir Radeon High Definition Audio Controller [1002:1637]
    ```
    In my case 1002 is the Vendor ID and 1637 is the Device ID.
  * Change to the directory where the `AMDGopDriver.efi` is located and run `EfiRom.exe -f VendorId -i DeviceId -e AMDGopDriver.efi -o AMDGopDriver.rom`. E.g. (assuming `EfiRom.exe` is in the same directory as the `AMDGopDriver.efi`):
    ```
    EfiRom.exe -f 1002 -i 1637 -e AMDGopDriver.efi -o AMDGopDriver.rom
    ```
* The file `AMDGopDriver.rom` and the file `vbios_1636.dat` (**make sure to select the one matching the GPU device ID if there are multiple files!**) can now be copied to the Proxmox host in the directory `/usr/share/kvm/` so they can be [referenced in the VM config](#Using-the-vBIOS-and-AMDGopDriver-in-the-VM-config).
